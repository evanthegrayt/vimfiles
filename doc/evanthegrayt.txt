ABOUT                                                             *evanthegrayt*

Sometimes I forget things. Also, a few people use my vim configuration, so this
will also serve as a way for people to learn my mappings and plugin settings.

SETTINGS                                                 *evanthegrayt-settings*

Most of my personal settings are kept in my vimrc file. Modern vim allows you
to keep your vimrc file as "~/.vim/vimrc", instead of "~/.vimrc". For this
reason, my vimrc is kept in the root of this repository.

For settings that require more advanced vimscript, check in the "plugin/" and
"autoload/" directories. They contain commands and functions that are like
mini-plugins. These are described in |evanthegrayt-mappings-and-commands|.

Please note that this repository used to support versions of vim less than 8.0.
This is no longer the case. If you're using an old version of vim, please
upgrade to 8.0+.

MAPPINGS AND COMMANDS                       *evanthegrayt-mappings-and-commands*

                                                      *evanthegrayt-vim-toggles*
Vim setting toggles~

section are performed in normal mode.

\ts    'spell'            off and spelllang=en_us
\tc    'conceallevel'     off and 2
\tC    'colorcolumn'      off and columns 81,101,121
\tm    'mouse'            "" and "a"
\tf    'foldcolumn'       off and 2

                                                 *evanthegrayt-custom-functions*
Custom functions~

These are mappings that perform custom functions. For modes, "n" is normal, "v"
is visual, etc.

                                                  *evanthegrayt-custom-commands*
Custom Commands~

Custom command definitions, unrelated to a plugin.

                                                                     *:Modeline*
:[{count}]Modeline[!]       Append a modeline to the top of the current file. If
                            ! is supplied, add to end of the file. If {count} is
                            supplied, the modeline will be placed at the
                            {count} line from the top of the file. When ! is
                            present, it will be placed at the {count} line from
                            the bottom of the file.


                                                                         *:Sloc*
:Sloc                       Display the number of Source Lines of Code.

                                                                      *:Standup*
:Standup[!] [{file}]        If the StandupMD ruby gem is installed, execute the
                            gem and open the {file} in a split. If ! is
                            supplied, open in a vertical split. If {file} is
                            not supplied, open the current month's file.
                            https://github.com/evanthegrayt/standup_md

                                                                          *:Cdc*
:Cdc {directory}            Poor man's implementation of my shell plugin "cdc",
                            linked below. In short, define *g:cdc_dirs* as a
                            list of directories. You can then use this command
                            to quickly change the working directory to a
                            subdirectory of one of the directories in the list.
                            If I ever add more features, this will probably
                            become its own plugin.
                            https://github.com/evanthegrayt/cdc

                                                                    *:Mksession*
:Mksession[!] [{session}]   Like |mksession|, but create a session file based
                            on current directory. If current directory is a git
                            repository, make a session file for the current
                            directory plus the current branch. Session files
                            are kept in "$HOME/.cache/vim_sessions", but the
                            directory can be changed with
                            *g:session_directory*.

                                                                 *:SessionStart*
:SessionStart [{session}]   Like |Mksession|, but continue tracking any window
                            changes. Must have tpope's vim-obsession installed.

                                                                  *:SessionLoad*
:SessionLoad [{session}]    Load the session file for the current directory. If
                            the current directory is a git repository, load the
                            session file for the current directory and branch.

                                                                *:SessionDelete*
:SessionDelete [{session}]  Delete the session file for the current directory.
                            If the current directory is a git repository, delete
                            the session file for the current directory and
                            branch.

                                                  *evanthegrayt-plugin-mappings*

                                                                           *:Ri*

THINGS I WANT TO REMEMBER                                *evanthegrayt-remember*

Random things I learn that I want to have quick access to remember. Things in
this section are subject to be removed as I commit them to memory.

Command Completion~
In command-line mode, <c-d> will show all completions for a command at once.

Global~
Delete all lines matching a pattern, or NOT matching a pattern. You can also
pass a range to delete the matching line, and the one(s) before or after it.
Raw VimScript can also be used.
>
    :g/pattern/d
    :v/pattern/d
    :g/pattern/-1d
    :g/^/if line(".") % 2 == 0 | d
    :g/^/if strlen(getline(".")) < 3 | d
<
Make a table of contents for markdown. The "t" command copies, "m" moves.
>
    :g/^##/t 1
    :g/^/m 1
<

Pattern Matching/Regex~
Find all methods with two arguments and swap the arguments.
>
    :%s/\v^\s*def\s+\w+\(\s*\zs(\w+)\s*,\s*(\w+)\ze\s*\)/\2, \1
<
Use "gn" to visually select the next match, and "gN" to select the previous.

Registers~
Use your most recent yank/delete in insert/command mode. For example, press / to
search, then '<c-r>"' as your search pattern.

Use '<c-r>=' in insert or command mode to evaluate an expression in-place.
>
    <c-r>=getcwd()
<

Changes~
Use "g;" and "g," to jump through the change list.

Help docs I can never find~
|mark-motions| to see how advanced jumps work.
|filename-modifiers| to see how to manipulate a file path.
|cmdline-special| to see how to grab things under the cursor.
|ins-completion| to learn vim's built-in completion.
|:Cfilter| to filter the quickfix/loclist.
|pattern| to learn about vim's regex engine.

PLUGINS                                                   *evanthegrayt-plugins*

This is a list of the plugins I use. You can hit "CTRL-]" on an item in the
left column to view its help documentation. If the item doesn't have its own
help documentation, then the syntax color will probably be the same color as
the URL, meaning this is the tag definition (see repeat as example). I did
this so I could easily jump to this list (":h repeat"), hit "gx" on the URL
to open the project in a browser, and read the README in the repository.
